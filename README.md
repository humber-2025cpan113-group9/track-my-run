# A **Track My Run**
Welcome to our project repo page.

we have build a webpage that allows users to plan what pace to be targeting to meet there goal. the website would have an assessement page where you are prompted to select goal distance, goal day, and goal time based on that information the result page would give you a week to week break down based on your goal pace.

see below our video on the build of our webpage.

 ## Homepage Demonstration:
our home page gives your a quick run down to what to expect from the assesment page. see below video for demonstration

 ## Assessment Demonstration:
we have setup an assement page where we asked the runners to answer three simple question. what is your goal distance? when is your race? and what time do you hope to finsih said race? as shown below on a short video

## Result Demonstration:
based on the answer we create a result where we have a breakdown table of what pace the runner need to aim per week up until race day. the runner would start at 80% of goal pace and get faster closer to race day. as shown below on a short video
