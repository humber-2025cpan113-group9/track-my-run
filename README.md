# A **Track My Run**
Welcome to our project repo page.

we have build a webpage that allows users to plan what pace to be targeting to meet there goal. the website would have an assessement page where you are prompted to select goal distance, goal day, and goal time based on that information the result page would give you a week to week break down based on your goal pace.

see below our video on the build of our webpage.

 ## Homepage Demonstration:
As stated, we've built a website that help runners plan their training schedule, helping establish accountability and structure. On the homepage navigation bar, there is a button that directs to the assessment page where the process begins.

 ## Assessment Demonstration:
Next, on the assessment page, we've created a simple three-question survey that asks the user the race type (distance) they are training for, their targe time, and the date which they wish to achieve this goal.

## Result Demonstration:
based on the answer we create a result where we have a breakdown table of what pace the runner need to aim per week up until race day. the runner would start at 80% of goal pace and get faster closer to race day. as shown below on a short video
