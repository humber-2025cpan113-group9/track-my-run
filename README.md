# **Track My Run**
Welcome to our project repo page.

we have build a webpage that allows users to plan what pace to be targeting to meet there goal. the website would have an assessement page where you are prompted to select goal distance, goal day, and goal time based on that information the result page would give you a week to week break down based on your goal pace.

see below our video on the build of our webpage.

 ## Homepage Demonstration:
The user journey begins on our homepage, where the objective of our website is clearly displayed: **THIS IS WHERE YOU START YOUR RUNNING JOURNEY**

As stated, we've built a website that help runners plan their training schedule, helping establish accountability and structure. On the homepage navigation bar, there is a button that directs to the assessment page where the process begins.

 ## Assessment Demonstration:
Next, on the assessment page, we've created a simple three-question survey that asks the user the race type (distance) they are training for, their targe time, and the date which they wish to achieve this goal.

## Result Demonstration:
Based on the user's input in the previous page, we then process and populate a weekly run schedule that gives a clear picture of the pace targets (minutes per mile) the runner should be aiming for, progressively moving towards their target starting at 80% the runner's capacity.
