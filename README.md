# A **Track My Run**
Welcome to our repo page.

we have build a webpage that allows users to plan what pace to be targeting to meet there goal. 
the website would have an assessement page where you are prompted to select goal distance, goal day, and goal time 
based on that information the result page would give you a week to week break down based on your goal pace. 

see below our video on the build of our webpage.
